# Known issues

Defects, test gaps, and debts found in Gas that are not fixed by the change
that found them. An entry stays here until the fix is merged; the fix removes
the entry in the same change, and, when the fix is visible to users, its
`CHANGELOG.md` entry records what was fixed.

Each entry has a stable ID (`KI-NNN`, never reused), and these fields:

- **Status**: `open`, `investigating`, `decision needed` (a §3 decision in
  `CLAUDE.md` is pending), or `fix in progress` with the branch or PR.
- **Area**: the module and package.
- **Found**: the date, and how it was found.
- **Detail**: what is wrong, with the evidence (error text, file and line,
  input that triggers it).
- **Next step**: what has to happen to close it.

## KI-004: built-in module constructors are not on the `CONVENTIONS.md` shape

- **Status**: open
- **Area**: the DI constructors of the built-in modules.
- **Found**: 2026-10-16, while writing `CONVENTIONS.md`.
- **Detail**: `CONVENTIONS.md` makes
  `func NewModule(opts ...Option) func(<dependencies>) (*Module, error)` the
  shape of every constructor whose result is registered in the DI
  container. On `main` none of them return an error:

  - `func(deps...) *Service`: `auth/jwt.New`, `auth/apikey.New`,
    `auth/session.New`, `auth/token.New`, `cache/memory.New`,
    `cache/valkey.New`, `database.New`, `email/ses.New` and
    `email/ses.NewWithCustomProvider`, `migrate.New`, `queue/sqs.New`, and
    `ui.New`.
  - `func(deps...) *Store`: `auth/apikey/db.New`, `auth/session/db.New`,
    `auth/token/db.New`, and `template/db.NewStore`.
  - `func() *Store`: `template/dir.NewStore(dir)` and
    `template/fs.NewStore(fsys)`.
  - `func() *<logger type>`: `gas.NewNopLogger`, `log.NewZeroLogLogger`,
    `log.NewSlogLogger`, and `log.NewShippingLogger`.

  Out of scope, because an app builds the value directly rather than
  registering a constructor: in core, `NewApp`, `NewWorker`, `NewRouter`,
  `NewServiceContainer`, `NewEventBus`, `NewContext`, and `NewError`;
  `auth.NewPrincipal`; `config.New`,
  `config/extensions/gasenv.NewExtension`, `config/providers`
  `NewDotEnvProvider`, `NewEnvProvider`, and `NewJSONProvider`,
  `config/providers/secretsmanager.NewProvider`, and
  `config/configtest.NewMockConfigWithValues`; `log.NewShippingHandler`
  and `log.NewOTLPMarshaler`; `template/composite.NewStore` and
  `template/memory.NewStore`; and `ui.NewEngine`. Generated sqlc code is out
  of scope too.
- **Next step**: migrate each module to the convention in its own PR.

## KI-010: suspected flake in the s3 multipart content-length test

- **Status**: open
- **Area**: `storage/s3` tests.
- **Found**: 2026-10-16, in review of the darwin lock-open fix, once in
  about 31 runs.
- **Detail**: the `multipart short` case of
  `TestProvider_PutObjectContentLength` (`storage/s3/provider_test.go:1088`)
  failed when an `UploadPart` send to the in-process fake S3 hit ENOBUFS
  (`write: no buffer space available`). The transfer manager keeps the first
  error, so that transport error masked `ErrContentLengthMismatch` and the
  `errors.Is` assertion failed. The runtime behavior is correct; only the
  assertion is fragile under transport errors.
- **Next step**: if it recurs, make the fake read the whole part before it
  replies, or accept a transport error in that case.
