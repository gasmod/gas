# Known issues

Defects, test gaps, and debts found in Gas that are not fixed by the change
that found them. An entry stays here until the fix is merged; the fix removes
the entry in the same change, and, when the fix is visible to users, its
`CHANGELOG.md` entry records what was fixed.

Each entry has a stable ID (`KI-NNN`, never reused), and these fields:

- **Status**: `open`, `investigating`, `decision needed` (a design decision
  is pending), or `fix in progress` with the branch or PR.
- **Area**: the module and package.
- **Found**: the date, and how it was found.
- **Detail**: what is wrong, with the evidence (error text, file and line,
  input that triggers it).
- **Next step**: what has to happen to close it.
